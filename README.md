# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## What is it?

This is my first attempt at creating an online portfolio that holds information about myself, telling you a little about myself. Showing off my "soon to be acquired skills" in multiple programming languages and finally some different ways to contact me and some links to my social media accounts (unfortunately donâ€™t have Spotify or Twitter but they link to the homepages of those websites). All Nav links should be responsive and take you directly to different portions of my portfolio. As well as the footer section, those links should respond to taking you to their corresponding sites. Lastly, when reducing the window size using flexbox the content within the page should be reshaped and take the form of the window size you are in.
